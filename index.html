            <p>my name's mira (she/her) and i'm a designer and engineer who loves to make digital products of all shapes
                and sizes!</p>
            <p>i studied <b>computer science</b> and <b>cognitive science</b> at the university of virginia. i took my
                first programming course in college and as someone who's always loved puzzles (sudoku, jigsaw, you name
                it), i was instantly hooked. i also loved my cognitive science classes and learning about the human mind
                and how people think, feel, and perceive. since graduating in 2020, i've been working
                at <b>deloitte</b> in both software engineer and product designer positions.</p>
            <p>my ideal role would be one that allows me to utilize both my <b>eye for design</b> and <b>technical
                    skillset</b> to bridge the gap between design and development and ultimately create accessible,
                memorable
                products.</p>
            <p>most importantly, i'm passionate about social impact and working somewhere that <b>centers community and
                    inclusivity.</b></p>
