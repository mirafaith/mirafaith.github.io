            <p>my name's mira (she/her) and i'm a designer and engineer who loves to make digital products of all shapes and sizes!</p>
            <p>i studied <b>computer science</b> and <b>cognitive science</b> at the university of virginia. i took my first programming course in college and as someone who's always loved puzzles (sudoku, jigsaw, you name it), i was instantly hooked. i also loved my cognitive science classes and learning about the human mind and how people think, feel, and perceive. since graduating in 2020, i've been working
            at <b>deloitte</b> in both software engineer and product designer positions.</p>
            <p>my ideal role would be one that allows me to utilize both my <b>eye for design</b> and <b>technical skillset</b> to bridge
            the gap between design and development and ultimately
            create accessible, memorable products.</p>
            <p>most importantly, i'm passionate about social impact and working somewhere that <b>centers community and
            inclusivity.</b></p>
            <p>when i’m not designing or coding, i love <a target="_blank" href="" class="accent">making spotify playlists</a>, playing musical instruments, and solving the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini" class="accent">new york times mini
            crossword</a>!</p>
